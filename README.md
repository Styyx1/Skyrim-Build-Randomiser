# Skyrim-Build-Randomiser
Randomises a character for your playthrough

# Usage:

extract the contents of the archives anywhere on the PC, leave the folder it comes in intact so it is in its own folder.

run the exe

It does not interact with the game in any way and is only meant to help with deciding on a playthrough.

Backstory generation adds a bit of flavor for roleplaying


To adjust the possible output to your mod setup, you simply need to change the txt files in ``/SettingFiles``
